## Run things in the cloud

Note: as of mid-2023, there is **such** demand for GPUs that it is more difficult to rent GPUs than it used to be. Colab remains a stable option, for short jobs.

## Editors

- [Online p5js editor](https://p5js.org) (pros: out of the box, online backup; cons: no live preview, some CORS issue and little available space for models and data)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) (pros: modern and extensible code editor, huge community, extensions for many programming languages; cons: steeper learning curve, need to install extensions for each language, **the recommended option**)
- [Brackets](https://brackets.io) (pros: simple to use, "one click" live preview in the browser; cons: not ideal for programming languages other than Javascript)
- [Vim](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlNDOBNFozLBCpi4Htz_r-g62FIDwKPtF) (pros: super extensible, an entire customisable syntax for text processing, [and it's also a cult!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war#Humor); cons: the steepest learning curve of all)
