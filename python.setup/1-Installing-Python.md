Installation instructions in the above links.

### Checking your installation

For Python, open a terminal and type `python --version` and/or `python3 --version`.

Note: to locate programs, and see if they are installed, use `which` on Linux/MacOs, `where` on Windows.

In a terminal, type `where/which conda`.

If it says something to the effect of `conda not found`, then you are good to continue with your installation.

Note: if you install things, often you need to reset or close the current terminal, then reopen a new one.
